Minefield
=========

A really simple minesweeper clone that runs in the browser.

I wrote this a few years ago as a for fun project to do a JS game. Looking back I can see that it's pretty unoptimized since it's munipulating the DOM and causing browser reflows constantly. Probably would be better with canvas these days, although canvas likely was an experimental technology back then.
